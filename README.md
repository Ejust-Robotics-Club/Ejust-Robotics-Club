# Welcome to Robotics Club Family
**Important Note**: Please Stay safe and in good health and take necessary precautions and commit to the preventive measures.

## Club Mission
Robotics Club aims at providing unique, challenging learning environments that
inspire E-JUST students to apply and improve their science, technology, engineering, and math
skills. Through a series of learning sessions, workshops, events, and seminars, we aim to keep up with the frontiers in the robotics field, and to organize and join competitions.

## Club Activties
1. The club will provide a series of learning sessions held by our supervisors, instructors,
engineers, or members to help our members build robot systems from scratch.

2. The club will also organize workshops, and students will aim at building and
programming robots and systems to achieve challenging functions/tasks. These
workshops will help students simulate competition environments and will be a platform
for the practical use of acquired knowledge. Workshops are to be held once every month.

3. The club will support the members to attend and participate in robotics events in Egypt.
Further more, we aim at organizing events relevant to the robotics field at E-JUST.

4. The club will organize seminars in cooperation with robotics professors at E-JUST.

5. The club will organize Robotics competitions among E-JUST students to solve
Engineering problems: designing, implementation, and operation of robotics products. 
Also, the aim of these competitions is to nurture and inspire the students to participate in
national and international competitions.

6. The club will organize several teams to participate in various national and international
competitions, such as “Minesweeper”, “Let’s make a robot”, “ROV”, “Formula SAE”,
“Aero design”, and so on.

7. The club will also seek to create a new international competition in the field of robotics
that will be hosted in E-JUST.

8. The club will provide the club members with needed supervision and support to help them publish their papers in honorable scientific journals and conferences.

9.  The club will have commerical branch which aims to marketing and selling developed robot kits built by club members.

## Summer Campaign Courses

- At this campaign, we will provide the students with unique courses that are considered as basics to help members get involved into robotics field. Those courses are selected so that they don't conflict or repeat fuclty courses, and concentrarte at practical aspects.
- This campaign is necessary for students and members to be able to hold and participate in upcoming activities and workshops. Those activities and workshops are to be held (on campus) by the start of the next semester (fall 2020) to implement what the students have learned throughout the campaign.
