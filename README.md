Important Note: Please Stay safe and in good health and take necessary precautions and commit to the preventive measures

### Club Mission
The Robotics Club aims at providing unique, challenging learning environments that
inspire E-JUST students to apply and improve their science, technology, engineering, and math
skills. Through a series of learning sessions, workshops, events, and seminars, we aim to keep up with the frontiers in the robotics field, and to organize and join competitions.

### Club Activties
1. The club will provide a series of learning sessions held by our supervisors, instructors,
engineers, or members to help our members build robot systems from scratch.

2. The club will also organize workshops, and students will aim at building and
programming robots and systems to achieve challenging functions/tasks. These
workshops will help students simulate competition environments and will be a platform
for the practical use of acquired knowledge. Workshops are to be held once every month.

3. The club will support the members to attend and participate in robotics events in Egypt
and also, we aim at organizing events relevant to the robotics field at E-JUST.

4. The club also will organize seminars in cooperation with robotics professors at E-JUST.

5. The club will also organize Robotics competitions among E-JUST students to solve
Engineering problems: designing, implementation, and operation of robotics products. 
Also, the aim of these competitions is to nurture and inspire the students to participate in
national and international competitions.

6. The club will organize several teams to participate in various national and international
competitions, such as “Minesweeper”, “Let’s make a robot”, “ROV”, “Formula SAE”,
“Aero design”, and so on.

7. The club will also seek to create a new international competition in the field of robotics
that will be hosted in E-JUST.

8. The club will provide the club members with needed supervision and fund to publish their papers in honorable scientific journals and conferences.

9.  The club will have commerical branch which aims to marketing and selling developed robots kit that builds by club members.

### Summer Campaign Courses

- At this campaign, we will provide the students with unique courses that may be considered to be a basics to get involved into robotics field dosen't conflict with their fucluty courses, and concentrarte into practical aspects.
- This step is very necessary to start in other activities and workshops to implement what we have learned once the studens return to the university at the new semestr.
